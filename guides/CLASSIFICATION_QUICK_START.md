## 🎓 For Training Tracking

**Important:** Mark crew leads with **F** or **GTO F**

When you run **Setup Training Tracking**, the system will:
- ✅ Find employees with F or GTO F classifications
- ✅ List them as "Crew Lead" in the training sheet
- ✅ Make compliance reporting easier

**Note:** GF, SUP, and GTO are available in the dropdown but are NOT recognized as crew leads for training purposes.
