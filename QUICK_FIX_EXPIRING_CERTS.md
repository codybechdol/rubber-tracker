## What You Just Did

The scan looked through your:
- **Gloves sheet** for items with expiring certs
- **Sleeves sheet** for items with expiring certs

And created a new sheet tab at the bottom called **"Expiring Certs"** with all items expiring in the next 60 days.

Now the To Do Config can read this data and let you configure automatic To Do tasks!

## Run the Scan Again Later

You should run this scan periodically (weekly or monthly) to keep the data fresh:
- Quick Actions → Manage Certs → Scan for Expiring Certs

## That's It!

You're all set. The clasp deployment is working, and the Expiring Certs feature is ready to use! 🚀
