# 🎯 DO THIS NOW - Simplified Import

## The Fix Is Deployed ✅

I simplified the logic based on your feedback:
1. ✅ Column B shows actual cert types (DL, OSHA 1910, Crane Evaluation, etc.)
2. ✅ Import just imports ALL certifications (no special "non-expiring" handling)
3. ✅ To Do Config loads employee certifications correctly
4. ✅ **YOU control which cert types create To Do tasks** via checkboxes in To Do Config

## What You Need To Do (3 Steps):

### 1️��� Refresh Your Sheet
In your Google Sheet, press **F5** (or click the refresh button)

### 2️⃣ Re-Import Your Excel Data  
1. **Quick Actions** → **📜 Manage Certs**
2. Click **"📤 Import New Excel Data"**
3. Paste your Excel data
4. Click **"Parse & Preview"**
5. Click **"Confirm Import"**

### 3️⃣ Configure Which Certs Create To Do Tasks

**In To Do Config:**
- **Quick Actions** → **⚙️ To Do Config** → **Expiring Certs** tab
- Check the boxes for cert types you want to track (DL, CPR, 1st Aid, etc.)
- Uncheck cert types you don't want in your To Do list
- Click "Save Changes"

Now only the cert types YOU selected will create To Do tasks!

## What Changed

**Before**: The code tried to be "smart" about non-expiring certs  
**Now**: Import everything, YOU decide what matters via checkboxes

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Simpler code, fewer bugs
- ✅ More flexible - you control what goes in To Do list
- ✅ All certs imported, you can see status for everything
- ✅ Column B always shows actual cert type

---

## That's It!

After re-importing, you'll have all certifications imported. Then use the checkboxes to control which ones create To Do tasks.

**Time needed**: ~2 minutes

**Status**: Simplified and ready! 🚀
